He worked primarily with the court orchestra of Prussia and later participated in operas at the courts of the French and Dutch courts, demonstrating his ability as a skilled conductor. Throughout his career, he achieved great success, both personally and professionally, but his most famous works include \"The Death of Sycorax\" (1735) and the opera \"Achille Leopoldus.\" The specific context regarding when he performed could vary based on the period he worked during; however, it would likely refer to his activities before or immediately following this timeframe, possibly suggesting that he was working towards a more substantial position or performing in the music scene around this time.",
